1. Passenger safety and legality
2. Perceived safety
   1. Minimizing passengers and other drivers notions of being unsafe
      1. e.g. increasing distance to a lead car
      2. e.g. not being too close to a lane divider
   2. Equates to increasing the margin of safety
   3. From here the planning model considers the notion of perceived
      safety,which here refers to minimizing passengers’ and other
      drivers’perceptions of being unsafe, even when actual safety
      isn’t at significant risk. (In practice, this might entail
      increasing the distance to a lead car or ensuring the autonomous
      car doesn’t get too close to a lane divider.) From [[https://venturebeat.com/2019/12/11/lyft-details-the-planning-model-behind-its-self-driving-cars/][ventureBeat]]

- Starting with symbolic stuff from
  [[https://towardsdatascience.com/explainable-ai-vs-explaining-ai-part-2-statistical-intuitive-vs-symbolic-reasoning-systems-8b05f8e0a3a0][data science]]
- Start with the symbols from the uber example and work backwards from
  the reasoner
- [ ] Timing analysis
- [ ] Validation of inconsistent labels 

** Dependencies
- Have to use =python3=
- Need =sympy=

** Requirements
- [ ] README in excel, markdown etc.  with the relations, and their
  meanings in natural language
- [ ] Optional: relations to query with their important meanings for
  the different applications.

    - [ ] How is this modeled?
    - [ ] Things that can cause harm to the vehicle:
      - Large objects and large moving objects (so want to avoid)

  - What we have =/query?node=/c/en/bicycle?rel=/r/AtLocation=
** TODO may also want to search for synonyms 
* TODO forward chaining versus backward chaining
** TODO Reasonable rules for labels 
*** TODO Do these first 
- if labels: then must be at the same location
- if move, subject must be able to move
** Rules
- Location check
  - Exception for objects because they are broad. 
** Forward chain rules first 
** Steps
- aggregate commonsense data
- Run rules
- More data
  - Look for alternative context 
** Adding PYKE

*** Family example
This example determines the relationships between people.

family.py
    This has the primary data used by the rest of the rules.  This data is
    established as universal facts so that it remains after an engine.reset()
    is done.

fc_example.krb
    Forward-chaining example.  This only uses forward-chaining rules, which
    means that all possible relationships are determined when the rule base is
    activated.

bc_example.krb
    Backward-chaining example.  This only uses backward-chaining rules, though
    these rules are not very efficient.

bc2_example.krb
    Backward-chaining example.  This also only uses backward-chaining rules,
    but a few rule optimizations have been made which results in this rule base
    running 100 times faster than bc_example.krb.

example.krb
    Combined rule base.  This has some forward-chaining rules, some
    (unoptimized) backward-chaining rules, and produces plans that return the
    relationship when run.  (This is a poor use of plans, but demonstrates the
    syntax and underlying principles).

driver.py
    Driver program.  Read this code to see how to call Pyke!

    The last function uses the bc2_example rule base.  You can pass whatever
    combinations of values you like.  If you want to specify person1 and/or
    person2, pass their name; otherwise any person will match.  For the
    relationship, pass a tuple.  Use '$var_name' strings in the tuple for
    pattern variables.  You can also have nested tuples (as some of the
    relationships are nested tuples).
*** Found PYKE3

- Installed with: =sudo python3 setup.py install=
  - And then changed install to build and that seemed ok for now.
